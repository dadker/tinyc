Hello! This may be the worst thing I've ever submitted in my life, but I tried. Maybe not my best try, but a try nonetheless.
I don't know what led me to thinking that taking this class would be "fun". It was not fun nor did I learn anything. Well anyways,
I apologize for the adbomination of code that you're about to read, and the failure of all test cases. Please spare me.
